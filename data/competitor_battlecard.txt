Competitor: LegacyCRM Systems
Our Win Strategy: Focus on "Time-to-Value".

Talking Points vs LegacyCRM:
1. Deployment Speed: LegacyCRM takes 6-9 months to implement. VelocityAI goes live in 3 days.
2. AI Capabilities: LegacyCRM claims "AI" but it's just rule-based triggers. VelocityAI uses real-time LLM processing.
3. Cost: We are 40% cheaper on Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) because we don't require external consultants.

Common Objections & Rebuttals:
- "LegacyCRM is the industry standard." -> Response: "It was the standard 10 years ago. Do you want innovation or maintenance?"
- "Migration is hard." -> Response: "We offer a 1-click migration tool specifically for LegacyCRM data."
